 PHP Data Structures and Algorithms Project

 Project Purpose
This project demonstrates fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in PHP.  
It includes examples of Recursion, Hash Tables, and Binary Search Trees (BST), with an optional integrated interface to test all modules.
Each part is designed to show how these core computer science concepts work in practice, using simple PHP scripts that can be run locally or via a web server.

 How to Run
The main.php file acts as the main controller that runs both the hash table and recursion scripts together. It includes or requires the other two PHP files
and executes their functions sequentially to display the combined output.
The hashtable.php file runs independently to demonstrate how data is inserted, searched, and displayed using a hash table structure.
The recursive.php file executes a recursive function that performs a specific task (such as calculating factorials or traversing data)
to show how recursion works in PHP. Each file can be run individually to observe its behavior, or all can be executed together through main.php.
